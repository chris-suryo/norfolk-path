# norfolk-path

A personal learning-project: a top-down **pixel-art fantasy RPG** built in
**Godot 4.7**, playable solo or **local 2-player on a shared screen** (WASD +
arrow keys), exported to **HTML5** so it runs from a browser link. Ultrawide
monitors are a first-class target (stretch viewport, not letterbox). The point
is learning the engine end-to-end, not shipping commercially.

## Status

- **DECIDED (2026-07-16): the valley map is the keeper — `island_map.gd` is
  UNFROZEN.** The cove becomes a future NE-quadrant extension (the map audit
  showed that corner is the natural site), not a world swap; the long-standing
  "pick a cove" item is closed. Round-1 playtest (PR #5) + map audit (PR #7)
  produced fixes now LIVE: web font space glyph, circle player collision,
  post-win keeps characters, UI legibility, bombschroom tell (PR #6), and the
  full M1–M13 map-polish slice (road→library approach, aligned doorsteps,
  treed beehives, closed pens, camp cleanup, windmill sails, villager/oak
  variety). **The testing loop is standardized** (`docs/testing-loop.md`):
  ci (lint + static rules incl. `check_map_rules.py`), visual-review
  composites, and a browser **playtest bot** that runs on every merge to main
  (`playtest.yml`) — its first run caught the broken chicken walk animation.
  Live-verify list for the next local round is at the end of
  `docs/playtest-findings.md`; the `.import` editor-generated commit is still
  outstanding (needs a Godot editor).
- **Continuous deploy is LIVE and verified end-to-end.** The 3 repo secrets
  (`VERCEL_TOKEN` / `VERCEL_ORG_ID` / `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`) are set, and a real
  run of `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml` went fully green: every push to the
  working branch exports the Godot Web preset and deploys to
  **https://norfolk-path.vercel.app** in ~90s, no manual export needed. Pinned
  to Godot 4.7-stable (Chris's exact local build) via
  `firebelley/godot-export@v8.0.0` (a third-party CI action — explicitly
  approved). Deploy uses Vercel's **Build Output API + `vercel deploy
  --prebuilt`**: the first attempt uploaded fine but hung 12+ min on Vercel's
  "Building…" step (the Git-imported project runs its own build pipeline over
  our already-exported files); staging the export into `.vercel/output/static`
  and deploying prebuilt makes Vercel serve the files directly with no build
  step. The manual drag-and-drop path in `docs/web-deploy.md` still works as a
  fallback.
- next: **Chris opens https://norfolk-path.vercel.app from another laptop** to
  confirm the game actually loads and is publicly reachable. The build session
  couldn't check this itself — its egress proxy blocks `vercel.app` (CONNECT
  403), unrelated to Vercel. If a Vercel login/SSO wall appears instead of the
  game, that's **Deployment Protection** on the project (Vercel dashboard →
  Project → Settings → Deployment Protection → disable Vercel Authentication);
  a dashboard-only toggle Chris controls.
- next: **Chris runs `docs/playtest-checklist.md` top-to-bottom** — one ordered
  pass over everything built while away (title/mouse/backdrop, collision fixes,
  animal wander, bombschroom, Irene's taunts, font fix, pause menu), each with
  its tuning knob. Also this session (unattended, no gameplay touched): **web
  build trimmed** (gdignored unused base-pack `Player/`+`Tiles/`+`Icons/`; asset
  payload 4.7→2.0 MB, seasonal packs already excluded); **P1/P2 assets staged**
  in `assets/game/` (not wired); new **`tools/check_assets.py`** guards asset
  refs / gdignore trims.
- next: **Chris verifies the enemy-variety + menu-polish batch on Windows.** On
  top of the confirmed respawn fix (Slice A): (1) the forest camp is now **3
  skeletons + 1 bombschroom** — a stationary `BombEnemy` (`scenes/
  enemy_bombschroom.tscn`) that idles until you're within ~22px, then flashes
  through a 0.6s wind-up and explodes (AoE + gas puff); defuse it with one sword
  hit during wind-up, or roll clear. (2) **Mouse support** on the title and pause
  menus alongside keyboard (hover-highlight + click-activate). (3) A **dressed
  title screen** — dimmed baked-world backdrop + UI_Frames NinePatch panel + 5x9
  pixel font + a looping campfire. Tuning knobs: bombschroom `detonate_radius`/
  `blast_radius`/`windup`/`max_hp` (all exported). Visual bits (title,
  bombschroom feel) are Chris's import gate.
- Slice A (spawn/checkpoint/respawn) — **playtest-confirmed**: New Game starts in
  the west village; checkpoints are progress-based (furthest area walked past);
  respawn rearms survivors (killed enemies stay dead), boss retries to full. The
  "no camp skeletons on Continue" was expected (a save past the camp clears it as
  already-done); a New Game keeps them.
- **Slice C — built & pushed (verify on Windows):** SAVE_VERSION bumped (old
  saves auto-invalidate to a clean New Game); font sub-pixel positioning disabled
  via a committed `.ttf.import` (fixes the boss "Icene" smear + all centered
  text — the one item that may need an editor re-import if the hand-authored
  `.import` is rejected); dash 150→105; two more Irene taunts (¾/¼ HP). Collision
  audit (beyond rocks): dropped the procedural ore scatter + re-baked (fixes
  walk-through AND duplicated near-house rocks); added colliders to berry bush &
  camp keg; widened under-sized building colliders (inn/cottages/barn were
  walk-through). Fixed the doubled duck (`$` removed, Ariana is the node) and the
  one flower-on-goose adjacency (relocated). **Animals now idle-bob + wander**
  (`scripts/ambient_animal.gd`; land animals stroll, water animals bob in place);
  also fixed Ariana rendering as 4 ducks (mis-framed 64px). Animation feel / font
  render are Chris's import gate.
- **Prep (not wired):** distinct P1/P2 sprites — the modular 64×64 sheet is now
  confidently mapped (`docs/player-modular-mapping.md`); idle/walk/attack/roll +
  a black/brown hair overlay for P1/P2, awaiting Chris's approval + live
  per-animation verification. **Still deferred:** boss Phase 2.
- earlier next: **Chris verifies the combat slice on Windows** (see
  `docs/combat-slice.md`). The whole real-time game loop is built headlessly
  (Stages 0–5, lint-clean, pushed): player-select (1P/2P) → walk the path →
  three encounters (2 slimes, a skeleton) with a **sword + dodge-roll** → **boss
  Irene** (throws books, HP bar, staged dialogue) → **win screen** → local save
  (localStorage on web) that survives a refresh. Co-op has a clear-to-revive
  rule; the 1P camera drops Player2. Controls: P1 = WASD + Space + C, P2 =
  arrows + `/` + `.`. **Not yet run in-engine** — Chris does the import/run/web
  loop and tunes positions/feel. **Gated next:** boss Phase 2 (minions; report
  first) and the cove world swap + pack buildings. [SUPERSEDED 2026-07-16: no
  swap — the valley map is the keeper and `island_map.gd` is unfrozen; the
  cove idea lives on as a future NE-quadrant extension.]
- earlier next (still open): **Chris picks a final enriched cove from
  `docs/world-options/`.** He
  chose the cove-3 (lakeside) direction; it's now enriched into three
  detailed variants — `cove3-rich-1` (balanced, recommended), `-2` (pastoral
  village with farm pens), `-3` (wild garden) — with animals (cow/pig/sheep +
  Ariana's chicken), lamp posts, rocks, stumps, wildflowers, garden flowers, a
  veg patch, and a chest, all aligned to the brief (see
  `docs/world-options/README.md`). Latest pass (3b) added **farmland fields**,
  signs, wheat, mushrooms and dialed back trees/rocks for texture variety.
  **The live map (`scripts/island_map.gd`) is still untouched** per Chris's
  hold. Applying the winner is now a bigger build step: drop its `.txt` into
  `island_map.gd` AND teach `level.gd`/`main.gd` the new symbols (`L` +
  `D o p e r u w f v i x n q m` — sprite/terrain + collision each). For varied
  buildings + a horse (absent from the free pack), Chris to buy the $2.99 full
  Cute Fantasy pack (`docs/asset-sourcing.md`). Still deferred: the 2P camera rule.

### v1 scope (the whole build — nothing beyond this without asking)

- Player-select screen: 1 Player or 2 Players (Mario-style)
- ONE hand-built top-down level leading to ONE boss fight
- Simple combat: HP + Attack only (no elemental types, no special moves)
- A few NPCs based on real friends — some allies, some comic villains
- Art: *Cute Fantasy RPG – 16×16* tileset pack (itch.io, free tier)
- Local browser save only (no login, no backend)
- Movement tuned a bit **weightier/slower** than default (an early prototype felt
  too fast/too precise — caused by snapping to max speed with no acceleration ramp)

**Explicitly NOT in v1:** login/cloud saves, type-chart combat, creature-catching,
true split-screen cameras, mobile port, custom hand-drawn art, special moves / skill
trees.

**SHIPPED means:** two people open a browser link, pick 1P or 2P, walk the level,
fight the NPCs (including the friend-based ones) and the boss, see a "quest complete"
screen, and their progress survives a refresh.

## Project specifics — commands

This is a **Godot / GDScript** project, so the global CLAUDE.md "standard scaffold"
(uv / pytest / ruff) does **not** apply here. Use these instead (Godot 4.7 binary
assumed on PATH as `godot`):

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Open in editor (Windows) | `godot --path . --editor` |
| Run the game | `godot --path .` (runs the main scene, `scenes/main.tscn`) |
| **First-time import** (run once per fresh clone, before anything else) | `godot --headless --editor --path . --quit` |
| Headless sanity-check (after the import cache exists) | `godot --headless --path . --quit` |
| Web export (headless) | `godot --headless --path . --export-release "Web" export/web/index.html` |
| Serve the web build locally (PowerShell) | `py -m http.server 8000 --directory export/web` → open `http://localhost:8000` |
| Lint GDScript (what CI runs) | `pip install gdtoolkit==4.5.0`, then `gdformat --check scripts/` and `gdlint scripts/` |
| **Edit the level** | change the ASCII grid in `scripts/island_map.gd` (legend at top of file) — terrain, props, and spawns all follow it; no editor painting needed |
| **Preview / validate the map** | `python tools/preview_map.py` → writes `docs/island-preview.png`, reports rule violations (must be 0). Dev-only tool, not in the game build (`.gdignore`). |

**Playtesting the movement feel is a human-in-editor task on Windows**, not something
the cloud build session can verify — movement lives in exported constants
(`max_speed` / `acceleration` / `friction` on the player) for tuning.

### Slice 1 decisions recorded by the build session

- **Web threads OFF** (`variant/thread_support=false` in `export_presets.cfg`):
  the export uses no SharedArrayBuffer, so it needs **no COOP/COEP headers** and
  runs from any plain static server (hence the simple `http.server` command
  above). Flip threads on later only behind a header-setting host.
- **Renderer = GL Compatibility** (WebGL 2), not Forward+ — the well-supported
  web path in Godot 4 and the safe choice for an HTML5-first project.
- **The level is an ASCII map** (`scripts/island_map.gd`), painted at runtime
  by `level.gd` and decorated by `main.gd` — the map string is the single
  source of truth for terrain, props (trees/fences/bridge), and spawn points.
  Shorelines and path borders autotile in code from the pack's 3×6 edge
  sheets via a neighbor bitmask (no editor terrain sets), with collision on
  water only (`B` bridge cells use a collision-free water source). Design
  rule the art imposes: keep water/path regions ≥ 2 tiles wide (the sheets
  have no strip tiles). The cloud session verifies layouts with a real-art
  preview renderer (scratchpad tool) before pushing.
- **Level design is a two-session handoff:** the story session owns the vision
  (writes `docs/world-brief.md`), the build session owns the geometry
  (translates it into `scripts/island_map.gd`) — see `docs/level-design.md` for
  the full loop. **Image models (diffusion) are explicitly NOT in the level
  pipeline** — they produce flat rasters with no grid/collision/tileset link;
  cohesion comes from story-driven layout iterated against the preview render,
  not one-shot generation. `tools/preview_map.py` is the shared eyes: it
  composites the real tiles the way the engine does and validates the design
  rules, so a brief-turned-map is checked before it hits the engine.
- **Camera zoom is an exported var** (`zoom_level` on Camera2D, default 2.5)
  — 3× felt too tight in the first browser test; tune it live in the
  Inspector.
- **Both players spawn as of Slice 2** (2P shared-screen test): camera tracks
  a midpoint node, deliberately WITHOUT leash/clamp logic — the "players walk
  apart" problem is meant to be felt in playtest before the camera rule is
  designed. Player-select (1P vs 2P) remains a later slice.
- **CI = gdtoolkit lint only** (see comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`): a
  headless-Godot import/export job couldn't be validated from the cloud session
  (egress blocked the engine download), so CI gates on `gdformat --check` +
  `gdlint`, which was proven green before commit. Promote a real import/export
  job once someone validates it locally.
- **Toolchain spike (plan Step 0) failed in the cloud** — github.com and
  godotengine.org are blocked by the session's egress policy, and no allowed
  mirror carries the engine. All engine-side checks (headless import, Web
  export, movement feel) are therefore local, human steps for now.
- **`.gitattributes` marks image/audio/font extensions `binary`** (good
  hygiene, kept) — but this was **not** the cause of the first Windows import
  failure. That was a real misdiagnosis: `git hash-object` on the Windows
  working copy matched `git rev-parse HEAD:...` exactly for both PNGs, proving
  the files were byte-identical to what's committed the whole time.
- **The chicken at the pond is a TEMPORARY stand-in for Ariana, who should be
  a DUCK.** A duck sprite download was attempted but didn't extract correctly;
  the pack's `Animals/Chicken/Chicken.png` fills the spot visually until a duck
  is sourced. Swap = replace the `Chicken` Sprite2D texture in
  `scenes/main.tscn` (frames are 2×2 of 32×32; adjust `hframes`/`vframes` to
  the duck sheet).
- **Art pack license caution:** the Cute Fantasy free tier allows
  non-commercial use and modification but **forbids redistribution, even
  modified**. The pack is committed to this repo — fine while the repo is
  private, but making the repo public would arguably be redistribution.
  Chris's call to revisit before any public hosting of the repo itself (the
  exported game build is a different question from redistributing the raw
  pack).
- **Real cause of "No loader found for resource" on first Windows import:**
  the project had *never* been imported (`.godot/` didn't exist yet), and the
  documented sanity command, `godot --headless --path . --quit` (no
  `--editor`), runs in runtime/game mode — which only loads *already-imported*
  resources and has no import pipeline. A brand-new headless checkout needs
  one `godot --headless --editor --path . --quit` pass first to build the
  `.godot/imported/` cache; only after that does the plain `--quit` sanity
  command work. Documented as a separate "first-time import" row above so
  this doesn't trip the next fresh clone (including CI, if a headless Godot
  job is ever promoted there).
